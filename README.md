# MLB Draft App!
## An App where you draft MLB players to teams. Every user gets 1 team
* I chose to do this app because I love baseball and I've always loved doing drafts whether it be on fantasy apps or in video games
* I used Google and YouTube for questions and examples, support time with classmates and instructors as my resources.
* Technologies used: React, Express, Tokens, MongoDB, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, VS code, live browser, and canva for app logo
* Planned future enhancements: I would really like to get the app functioning completely. And stretch goals would be to add a lot more to the app, as far as more stats or pictures
